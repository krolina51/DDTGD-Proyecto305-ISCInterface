<p>The PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) has defined a set of best 
  practices, called the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS), 
  which are aimed at assisting software vendors to create secure payment 
  applications. For a complete listing of S1 Corporation components and versions that are PA-DSS validated, please see the PCI website: <a HREF="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" target="_blank">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/</a></p>
<p>The following statement from the <i>Payment 
  Card Industry PA-DSS Vendor Release Agreement</i> between the PCI SSC 
  and S1 Corporation applies only to those licensed products listed on the PCI 
  website as being approved: </p>
"<b>Legal Terms and Conditions</b>
<p>Acceptance of a given payment application by the PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (PCI SSC) only applies to the specific version of that payment application that was reviewed by a PA-QSA and subsequently accepted by PCI SSC (the "Accepted Version"). If any aspect of a payment application or version thereof is different from that which was reviewed by the PA-QSA and accepted by PCI SSC – even if the different payment application or version (the "Alternate Version") conforms to the basic product description of the Accepted Version – then the Alternate Version should not be considered accepted by PCI SSC, nor promoted as accepted by PCI SSC.</p>
<p align="justify"> No vendor or other third party may refer to a payment application as "PCI Approved" or "PCI SSC Approved", and no vendor or other third party may otherwise state or imply that PCI SSC has, in whole or part, accepted or approved any aspect of a vendor or its services or payment applications, except to the extent and subject to the terms and restrictions expressly set forth in a written agreement with PCI SSC, or in a PA-DSS letter of acceptance provided by PCI SSC. All other references to PCI SSC's approval or acceptance of a payment application or version thereof are strictly and actively prohibited by PCI SSC.</p>
<p align="justify">When granted, PCI SSC acceptance is provided to ensure certain security and operational characteristics important to the achievement of PCI SSC's goals, but such acceptance does not under any circumstances include or imply any endorsement or warranty regarding the payment application vendor or the functionality, quality, or performance of the payment application or any other product or service. PCI SSC does not warrant any products or services provided by third parties. PCI SSC acceptance does not, under any circumstances, include or imply any product warranties from PCI SSC, including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for purpose or noninfringement, all of which are expressly disclaimed by PCI SSC. All rights and remedies regarding products and services that have received acceptance from PCI SSC, shall be provided by the party providing such products or services, and not by PCI SSC or any payment brands."</p>
